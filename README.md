## 1 

Implement ```print_neighbours ``` method in graph_class which prints all neighbours for given vertex vex
E.g. in out example for Maciek it should print 'Pola'

## 2

Take a look at the ```relations2.txt``` notice that you have only six lines there. Notice that
each of them represents an edge in the graph. Write a **function** in main.py that will build a relations
dictionary based only on those edges. Make sure that the graph you represent is an undirected one!
You can get inspired by the ```cheatsheet.py``` file
## 3

What would you do if the edges were directed?

**Try** to, instead of making a relation dictionary, build a graph_class
